                                can
                                be daunting. Factor in the promise of falls
                                from great heights, and it&apos;s no wonder that most people gave more knots in their
                                stomachs than in
                                their ropes when they first start climbing. The lingo sounds like an entirely different
                                language&mdash;basically Cockney rhyming slang&mdash;and then you&apos;re also
                                hyper-aware that your
                                life literally depends on getting it all right. Put your trust in the gear we&apos;ve
                                assembled here in
                                our guide for climbing gear for beginners, which will provide everything you absolutely
                                need and nothing
                                that&apos;s just marketing fluff. Most climbers get acquainted with the safety routines,
                                jargon, and
                                gear when climbing indoors. But it&apos;s fine to start outdoors if you fall in with the
                                right climbers
                                or enrol in an American Mountain Guides Association&ndash;accredited course.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:16px;">Whether you&apos;re indoors or outdoors, you&apos;re
                                going to
                                need some essential gear. I&apos;m keeping it simple and affordable in this guide, since
                                it&apos;s easy
                                to get overwhelmed by all the jargon for technical gear. You&apos;re also not going to
                                be a climbing
                                lead until you&apos;re more experienced, so I&apos;ve omitted items like rope and quick
                                draws, which
                                your climb leader will have. You can get by with any flexible clothes (no jeans!), but I
                                suggest you
                                veer toward technical synthetic layers for climbing outside.</span></p>

                                This one from Black Diamond has been my go-to since the beginning of 2018. It&apos;s
                                well padded
                                and super comfy, and the fixed leg loops have never given me trouble. It has enough gear
                                loops
                                for carabiners and quick draws to lead and follow on sport routes, but not enough to
                                carry
                                anchoring equipment for trad climbing. That&apos;s fine. As a beginner, you&apos;ll be
                                sport
                                climbing anyway.</span></p><br><br>

                <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">Shoes are an intensely personal choice, and you&apos;ll
                                probably have to try on a few pairs to find the right ones. Remember: you don&apos;t
                                wear socks
                                in climbing shoes. They should be tight but not painfully tight. Some people prefer
                                laces to
                                cinch them up. Others prefer Velcro because it&apos;s quicker to put on and take off
                                between
                                climbs. I like the Origin from Scarpa because they&apos;re a well-built, relatively
                                non-aggressive (flatter-soled) shoe good for beginners.</span></p>


                <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">As you take on more difficult climbs, you&apos;ll
                                eventually want to buy a pair of more aggressively curved climbing shoes, like the
                                excellent La
                                Sportiva VS Miura for $199. But the Origin will always have a place in your rotation
                                when your
                                climbs demand a lot of sole-to-rock contact, like granite slabs.</span></p><br><br>

                <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">When top-rope climbing, the person on the wall is secured
                                via the rope to the anchors on the wall by a partner&mdash;a belayer&mdash;who stands
                                below with
                                hands on the rope, ready to catch the climber when they fall. They use a belay device to
                                do so.
                                The ATC Guide is the benchmark to beat. Tough, versatile, and usable in the gym or
                                outdoors,
                                mine has never let me down. Fun fact: ATC stands for &ldquo;air traffic
                                controller.&rdquo;</span></p><br><br>

                                        GriGri is an assisted-braking device, which means that when the climber falls,
                                        the device
                                        catches them rather than the belayer&mdash;though the belayer still needs to
                                        stand ready with
                                        hands on the rope for safety.&nbsp;</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">The big risk isn&apos;t equipment failure,
                                        it&apos;s
                                        operator failure. Every so often a belayer freezes up when their climbing
                                        partner falls, and
                                        they forget to let go of the brake release lever. Then the falling climber decks
                                        (hits the
                                        ground). So if you&apos;re going to use an assisted-braking belay device like
                                        the GriGri, drill
                                        it into your head to get your hand off the lever when your climber falls. That
                                        said, many belay
                                        partners have caught my falls with the GriGri, and I trust myself to
                                        them.</span></p>

                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">I&apos;ve fallen in love with these because,
                                        unlike
                                        traditional carabiners, they&apos;re almost impossible to snag on a rope or
                                        harness gear loop.
                                        The nose&mdash;the part of the carabiner that the open end of the gate clips
                                        to&mdash;is a
                                        snag-free design that really works. It sounds like a small deal, but repeated
                                        hundreds of times
                                        over a day, a snagging carabiner can be really annoying. And I can&apos;t deny
                                        that their snappy
                                        choice of DMM&apos;s colour palettes helps you look good on the wall.</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">Pear-shaped HMS carabiners manage large amounts
                                        of rope
                                        better than non-HMS carabiners, so if you only carry one locker, carry an HMS
                                        and use it for
                                        belaying and rappelling. If you progress later to building anchors or using a
                                        Munter hitch, more
                                        room for the rope. You only need one of these right now.</span></p><br><br>

                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">You won&apos;t need wire-gate carabiners if
                                        you&apos;re
                                        only climbing indoors. Outdoors, you&apos;ll want a handful in addition to a
                                        couple of locking
                                        carabiners. Carabiner manufacturers are always working on ways to reduce weight
                                        and rope-snag.
                                        The 33-gram Dyon has an inventive gate that starts as a conventional wire gate
                                        on the hinge end
                                        and then morphs into a single, thick pin that loops over the open end&apos;s
                                        nose. Gate action
                                        is smooth, and it&apos;s almost impossible to snag the nose on ropes and gear
                                        loops.</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">Wire gates have mostly replaced standard solid
                                        gates, as
                                        they&apos;re lighter and less susceptible to gate chatter or gate
                                        flutter&mdash;that noise you
                                        hear in a fall when the weight of the gate briefly makes itself pop slightly
                                        open. It&apos;s
                                        rarely a big deal, but, climbers are always thinking about risk
                                        management.</span><br><br><br><span style="color:#979797;font-size:7.5pt;"><span

                                        climbing. It&apos;s not absolutely necessary, but it&apos;s nice to have. Loose
                                        chalk is fine,
                                        but for less of a mess, put it in a chalk sock. Whenever you need a little extra
                                        grip on the
                                        climbing wall, give the chalk sock a feel and your hands will be nicely coated
                                        without sending a
                                        dust plume into the air.</span></p>

                                        one that can be refilled with more chalk whenever you deplete it. After all, the
                                        more you can
                                        reuse, the less that&apos;ll end up in a landfill.</span></p><br><br>

                                        weather. I dig the
                                        Wall Rider because of its hybrid construction, with a partial hard shell and
                                        foam. The shell
                                        keeps smaller rocks from pelting you in the noggin while retaining all the
                                        benefits of
                                        foam.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        Protection System) version, and if your budget can stretch, it&apos;s worth
                                        shelling out for it
                                        (no pun intended). There&apos;s an inner liner that allows the outer plastic to
                                        rotate slightly,
                                        so it reduces rotational forces on the brain.</span></p><br><br>

                                        provided solid
                                        abrasion protection, and the breathable cloth construction everywhere else
                                        helped keep my hands
                                        from sweating in the midday sun, unlike all-leather gloves. I&apos;ve gotten
                                        years of use out of
                                        mine. There&apos;s a Crag Half Finger Glove for $20 &nbsp;that&apos;s identical,
                                        except
                                        it&apos;s cooler on hot days and affords you a bit more fingertip dexterity. I
                                        found it easier
                                        to tie and untie knots with the half-finger version.</span></p><br><br>

                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">If you plan to tackle outdoor climbs, you&apos;ll
                                        need a
                                        backpack capable of hauling all your gear out there. The Creek 20 is the perfect
                                        size for
                                        carrying all the equipment required for sport climbs, which is what you ought to
                                        start out
                                        climbing. While you can use a typical day pack for climbs, it helps to have a
                                        beefier pack built
                                        for the job. Rocks are abrasive and sharp, and the climbing gear that goes in
                                        your pack will be
                                        heavy. Having a hip belt and sternum strap will make lugging your climbing
                                        shoes, harness,
                                        carabiners, belay device, snacks, and clothing layers more bearable.</span></p>

                                        also
                                        impressed me alongside the DMM Dyon. The wire gate is more conventional than the
                                        Dyon, but like
                                        the Dyon it&apos;s completely snag-free, as DMM has effectively eliminated the
                                        notch on the
                                        nose. At 36 grams, it&apos;s unnoticeably heavier than the Dyon and a few
                                        dollars more
                                        expensive.</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">Our old recommendation for a locking carabiner,
                                        the
                                        C.A.M.P. Photon Locking Carabiner for $13, and the non-HMS DMM Phantom Locking
                                        Carabiner for
                                        $16. Both are excellent choices if you need snag-free lockers with buttery
                                        smooth screw gates
                                        and relatively lowish weight. I didn&apos;t notice any difference in building
                                        quality between
                                        the two.</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">There are various locking mechanisms for locking
                                        carabiners, including twist-lock and magnet-operated ones. They&apos;re all
                                        fine, but go with
                                        the classic screw-gate, which is much cheaper. It&apos;s what I use. If it gets
                                        stuck, apply
                                        some outward pressure (put it under load) and then try unscrewing it.</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">The C.A.M.P. Nano 22 Wiregate for $7 was my old
                                        pick, but
                                        I got tired of rope snagging the nose. Its schnoz has a reduced protrusion
                                        compared to
                                        traditional carabiners, so it&apos;s not terrible, but it&apos;s also not
                                        snag-free. Plus,
                                        they&apos;re awfully small, and so building anchors on them can quickly become
                                        cumbersome.
                                        They&apos;re still a fine choice for when you&apos;re prioritizing low weight at
                                        a low price,
                                        such as clipping quick draws.</span></p>


                        <p><span style="color:#1a1a1a;font-size:12pt;">A burlier option, the Metolius Belay Gloves for
                                        $40,
                                        certainly felt more substantial than the Black Diamond Crag gloves, but
                                        they&apos;re overkill
                                        for most routes. Being made completely of cowhide with reinforced palms, they
                                        made me feel like
                                        I could&apos;ve used them to grab onto a passing locomotive. The downside is
                                        that in the summer
                                        heat, they sure get sweaty.</span></p>

                                        performed admirably, but its non-scalloped edges made it extraordinarily heavy
                                        at 85
                                        grams&mdash;twice the weight of the other lockers I tested. Most people
                                        won&apos;t need
                                        something this huge. Plus, the nose had a tendency to snag on everything.</span>
