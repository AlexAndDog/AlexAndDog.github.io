        <p>Heli-skiing - two simple words that make your heart race and the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. The
            pinnacle of powder bucket lists, and an adventure that all skiers and boarders should experience once in
            their lifetime. British Columbia offers some of the best heli-skiing in the world, with more reliable
            weather, snowfall and lower prices than Alaska, whilst still having some of the wildest and most beautiful
            terrain on the planet. It also doesn't hurt as much paying in Canadian Dollars!</p><br><br>

                        SINGLE-DAY HELI-SKIING: WHISTLER</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Mabey Ski&rsquo;s hometown and North America&rsquo;s
                largest ski resort is famous for its glitzy village stroll and unfathomable amounts of powder, and
                it&rsquo;s no secret that Whistler can get busy at times. Escape the crowds and heli-ski the huge
                tenures of the Sea-to-Sky corridor with one of the 2 operators in the vicinity. The resort-owned
                Whistler Heli-Skiing offers 3, 4 and 6 run packages (as well as private packages) right from Whistler
                Village.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>With more powder runs than you can shake a stick at,
                people are rarely disappointed with a day here, and it has the advantage that you don&rsquo;t have to
                fork out for an entire week&rsquo;s stay at a lodge. New kid on the block, Phantom Heli, runs heli-ski
                packages in the enormous mountains behind Squamish BC &ndash; offering huge vertical runs on impressive
                glaciers. As well as being able to heli-ski your way up to Whistler from Vancouver Airport, they are
                also the first lodge-based heli-ski operator to be flying out of Whistler.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PRICE </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Starting from CAD$1,239/person.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PROS </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Easy access. Transparent run
                packages.&nbsp;</span><span>Warm up days in the ski
                resort. Good for first-time heli-skiers. Ideal for mixed groups. Flexibility.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>CONS </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Frequent no-fly days due to weather. Not much
                cheaper than lodge-based heli-skiing per day. Accommodation not included.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>LOCAL TIP&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Book your heli-ski day early on your trip, in case
                of weather delays.</span></p><br><br>

                    HELI-SKIING&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Nestled in the Skeena Mountains of northern British
                Columbia, Last Frontier offers two different lodge-based heli-ski experiences &ndash; the main one being
                the purpose-built heli-ski lodge, Bell 2 Lodge. Flying into the remote town of Terrace, your driver will
                pick you up and drive you deep into the mountains to your off-grid home-away-from-home. Complete with
                hot tub, outdoor fire pit, games room, sauna and more, we wouldn&rsquo;t blame you for spending a week
                relaxing in your private cabin at the lodge, but with 10,100 sq km of terrain, there is no shortage of
                epic powder skiing here. For a remote but sociable wilderness experience in some of the most spectacular
                mountains in BC, Bell 2 Lodge is tough to beat.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>If you are looking for a slightly more rugged
                experience, Last Frontier&rsquo;s second lodge, Ripley Creek, is ideal. It&rsquo;s perfect for a group
                of hardcore ski friends looking for high quality, low density powder and rustic accommodation. Located
                in the town of Stewart, right on the Alaska border, Ripley Creek receives 30% more snowfall than Bell 2
                (which already receives some of the highest annual snowfall in the world), and offers everything from
                steep trees to couloirs, to top-to-bottom glacier runs. This lodge also happens to offer some of the
                best lodge&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PRICE </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Starting from CAD$8,400/person for 4 days&rsquo;
                heli-skiing (all-inclusive).&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PROS </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Reliable snowfall. Terrain size and choice. Steeps
                and tree skiing available. Small groups. Guaranteed vertical. Value for money. Remote
                location.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>CONS </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Longer transfers.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>LOCAL TIP&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Take advantage of early season prices, and make sure
                to book early.</span></p><br><br>

        <p><span><strong><span style="font-size: 17px;">BEST LUXURY
                        HELI-SKIING: BELLA COOLA, BC&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>With four lodges and a 138ft yacht to heli-ski from,
                there is no shortage of options in Bella Coola. Enormous mountains, never-ending glaciers and
                summit-to-ocean ski lines make it one of our favourite places to heli-ski. With sumptuous breakfasts and
                3-course dinners, the five-star food is all part of the experience &ndash; and even without world-class
                skiing on your doorstep, the remote and coastal town of Bella Coola has so much on offer. Expect small
                group heli-skiing, outrageous views and terrain ranging from pro-skier territory, to mellow, rolling
                meadows and glaciers. The historic Tweedsmuir Park Lodge is their flagship property, with private cabins
                surrounding the main lodge &ndash; you walk straight from your bed to breakfast, then onto heli, and
                finally apr&egrave;s. Just how we like it. If you have a private group, we recommend either Pantheon
                heli-ranch for up to 9 guests, or Mystery Mountain for the ultimate private experience for just 5
                guests. Want to step it up a notch? New for 2023, you can heli-ski from your private 138ft yacht &ndash;
                sleeping in a different mooring each night, whilst skiing and naming first descents by day.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p><span><strong>PRICE </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Starting from CAD$7,480/person for 3 days&rsquo;
                heli-skiing (all-inclusive).&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PROS </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Scenery. Food. Luxury touches. Small groups. Variety
                of terrain. Private options available. Overall experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>CONS </strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Expensive (but worth it).&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>LOCAL TIP</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Book early &ndash; spaces sell fast. We suggest at
                least 12 months ahead.</span></p><br><br>

                    CHALETS: HELI-SKI FROM YOUR FRONT DOOR</span></strong></span></p>
        <p><span>If you&rsquo;re looking for a true
                home-away-from-home experience, where non-skiers are welcome too, we have a couple of incredible
                properties for you. Bighorn Lodge in Revelstoke is nestled at the base of the ski run of Revelstoke
                Mountain Resort in the interior of BC &ndash; fully catered, with 15,000 sq ft of space for up to 16
                guests. Expect Michelin star-worthy food, a private helipad ready to take you heli-skiing right from
                your door, as well as a huge outdoor hot tub, sauna, pool, cinema and games room.</span></p>
        <p><span><br></span></p>
        <p><span>Moving west back towards Whistler, Belmont Estate is
                an absolute mega-chalet, located in the exclusive gated community of Stonebridge (not that a gate
                matters when you have a chopper). Tucked away from neighbours, whilst overlooking the immense ski resort
                of Whistler Blackcomb, this is one of the few private heli-ski estates in BC, with private packages
                provided by Whistler Heli-Skiing and Blackcomb Helicopters. Again, perfect for families and groups with
                non-skiers as well as skiers.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PRICE</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Starting from CAD$10,000/night for exclusive
                use.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>PROS</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Private heli-skiing. Ultimate luxury chalet. Fly
                from your driveway. Warm up days in resort. Ideal for mixed groups and celebrations. Flexibility.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span><strong>CONS</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Expensive.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>LOCAL TIP</strong></span></p>
        <p><span>Buy lift passes for pre-heli-ski warm up days
                &ndash; Whistler and Revelstoke resorts are two of the best resorts in the world. These chalets are also
                in hot demand, so try to book 12 months ahead.</span></p><br><br>

        <p><span>Just a quick 20-minute drive from Terrace Airport,
                the Northern Escape lodges are great for groups after a little more bang for their buck &ndash; or those
                looking for a great social experience in the serene Skeena Mountains. With packages starting at
                CAD$5,599 for 4 nights, 3 days this is an excellent option for those who are a little more budget
                conscious. An extra bonus here is that for any down days due to weather, there is a snowcat (adapted
                piste-basher/grooming machine) available to take you cat-skiing right from the lodge &ndash; how&rsquo;s
                that for service! Averaging 44,000 vertical meters per week, it&rsquo;s certainly good value here, and
                with unlimited vertical options, the hardcore skiers out there can ski as hard as they can to try and
                get on the leaderboard!</span></p>
