                                                Face&rsquo;s Wawona 6 gets our top billing for 2023, with a
                                                spacious,
                                                tunnel-like interior that sleeps up to six, a massive front
                                                vestibule
                                                that doubles as a covered seating area, and hybrid double-wall
                                                construction that vents well and isn&rsquo;t prone to condensation
                                                buildup. The Wawona comes in both four- and six-person varieties,
                                                but we
                                                love the six-person even for smaller families (it&rsquo;s great for
                                                hanging out in inclement weather), and the 80-inch peak height means
                                                that most won&rsquo;t have to hunch over when inside. At $500 for

                                                pieces
                                                of gear, we have our gripes with the Wawona. First, it&rsquo;s
                                                considerably time-consuming and tedious to set up. The vestibule in
                                                particular must be guyed out tightly to stay upright, and the unique
                                                pole structure takes some time to get taut and secure. Second, the
                                                rainfly doesn&rsquo;t cover the lower portion of the tent (not ideal
                                                in
                                                blowing rain), and the all-mesh door can lead to heat loss and
                                                drafts
                                                (for a more weather-worthy option, check out REI&rsquo;s Base Camp
                                                6 mentioned above). But no tent is perfect, and the
                                                Wawona&rsquo;s breathable build, expansive interior and vestibule,
                                                and
                                                reasonable price make it a market standout.</p><br><br>

                                                market has exploded as of late, and Colorado-based Roofnest has set
                                                itself apart with a number of premium designs. While many companies
                                                (like Thule, for example) specialize in softshell tents, Roofnest
                                                offers
                                                three styles of hardshells, which we prefer for their durability,

                                                hybrid and our current favorite: Unlike most hardshell options that
                                                are
                                                set up by simply popping the top, the Condor features a fold-out
                                                design
                                                that effectively doubles the size of the footprint. The end result
                                                is a
                                                sleeping area for four (larger than a king-size bed), alongside all

                                                the originator of the fold-out hardshell&mdash;that was iKamper with
                                                their Skycamp&mdash;but their take on the concept offers similar

                                                at a better price. For $500 less than the Skycamp 3.0, the Condor
                                                tacks

                                                footprint (easier to maneuver on and off). But if you&rsquo;re a

                                                traveler or couple, the king-size bed of these premium hybrids might
                                                feel over the top, and you can save by opting for a pop-up or

                                                style like the Roofnest Sparrow or Falcon instead. True budget

                                                will want to look at softshell tents, and our favorite is the&nbsp;

                                                variety of constructions to choose from, but we&rsquo;ve come to
                                                prefer
                                                the combination of self-inflating design with a soft foam core. The
                                                Therm-a-Rest MondoKing 3D nails the formula, with 4.25 inches of

                                                vertical sidewalls that allow you to spread out to the very edge

                                                being at risk of falling off, soft yet durable fabric, and inner

                                                comes with dedicated inflate/deflate valves, making it quicker and
                                                easier to set up and take down.&nbsp;</p>

                                                the MondoKing 3D is its large packed size, which measures over two
                                                feet
                                                long by almost a foot wide. For those with limited storage space or
                                                small vehicles, bulky gear can add up quickly. You can streamline
                                                considerably with a design like the Nemo Roamer, which
                                                packs down to almost half the size; however, you&rsquo;ll pay $10
                                                more
                                                for the Roamer&rsquo;s added compressibility, and it&rsquo;s not
                                                quite
                                                as warm or thick as the Therm-A-Rest (surprisingly, it&rsquo;s also
                                                heavier). Either one might seem cost-prohibitive to the occasional

                                                checks all the boxes for most recreational campers in a well-built

                                                degrees will keep you cozy down to around freezing (with a

                                                10-degree buffer added in), and the roomy rectangular shape is
                                                comfortable and not restrictive (bonus: It comes with a hood, which
                                                isn&rsquo;t always the case with rectangular models). The bag also

                                                Siesta
                                                Hooded 20 is a great value from a brand we trust.</p>
                                            <p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size: 16px;">But there are a few
                                                downsides to keep in mind with the Siesta Hooded 20&rsquo;s design.
                                                While most campers will appreciate the spaciousness of a rectangular
                                                bag, it does translate to reduced warmth, as there&rsquo;s simply
                                                more
                                                air inside for your body to keep warm. In other words, a mummy bag
                                                is a
                                                far more efficient style, although the Siesta does come with a draft
                                                collar and cinch cord for helping seal in heat (plus the
                                                aforementioned
                                                hood). Second, the synthetic insulation lacks the premium loft,
                                                warmth-to-weight ratio, and packability of down. The flip side is a
                                                much
                                                lower price tag, along with a more durable design that can handle
                                                being
                                                thrown around (you don&rsquo;t have to worry about feathers
                                                escaping)
                                                and the odd bit of moisture. For most campers, a bag like the Siesta
                                                Hooded is a great combination of features and value, and it also
                                                comes
                                                in a two-person Double

                                                a great camping blanket?
                                                Warmth, durability, and value, for starters. Our top pick, the

                                                Puffy from Rumpl, hits all three&mdash;plus more. Rumpl is a
                                                relatively
                                                new brand, but they&rsquo;ve helped define the modern camping
                                                blanket as
                                                we know it. Their flagship model, the Original Puffy, combines thick
                                                three-season-ready synthetic insulation with a reasonably
                                                hardwearing
                                                30-denier shell and a durable water-repellent (DWR) finish to shed
                                                light
                                                moisture. A great selection of patterns and colorways adds to the
                                                blanket&rsquo;s appeal, and it also sports thoughtful features like
                                                the
                                                &ldquo;Cape Clip&rdquo; to secure the blanket around your shoulders
                                                and
                                                corner loops for anchoring it down in the wind.&nbsp;</p>

                                                consideration when shopping for a camp blanket is size. We
                                                appreciate
                                                the Rumpl&rsquo;s 75-inch by 52-inch dimensions, but you can go even
                                                larger with a design like Kammock&rsquo;s
                                                Mountain Blanket (84 x 50 in.), which is around $40 pricier than
                                                the Rumpl but considerably warmer with a thick fleece build. You can
                                                also step up to a two-person blanket like the Therm-a-Rest Argo
                                                ($125),
                                                which measures 72 by 78 inches. And if you&rsquo;re looking for a
                                                better
                                                warmth-to-weight ratio, it&rsquo;s worth considering a
                                                down-insulated
                                                blanket like the Rumpl Down Puffy
                                                Blanket or Kelty Galactic Down&mdash;just keep in mind that down
                                                is overall less hardwearing than synthetic (you&rsquo;ll want to
                                                keep it
                                                in your tent for the most part) and significantly pricier to boot.
                                                Ultimately, we prefer the versatility and affordability of a
                                                synthetic
                                                blanket like the Original Puffy.&nbsp;</p>

                                                weighs heavily for many camping chair
                                                shoppers&mdash;some prioritize cushy comfort while others prefer a
                                                lighter and more packable setup. Our top pick, the REI Co-op
                                                Skyward,
                                                achieves a great balance of these qualities at a reasonable price.
                                                Its
                                                strong steel frame inspires confidence, while X-shaped webbing in
                                                the
                                                seat and backpanel helps distribute weight evenly. And despite its
                                                sturdy build, the chair features a lot of mesh, allowing it to
                                                breathe
                                                well in warm weather and dry super quickly. Once you&rsquo;re
                                                sitting,
                                                cup holders and drop-down pockets at the armrests provide convenient
                                                places to stow drinks or small items like keys or a phone. For just
                                                $60,
                                                you&apos;d be hard-pressed to find a better value than the Skyward.

                                                noting
                                                that the Skyward replaced REI&rsquo;s popular Camp X for 2023, and
                                                the
                                                biggest change was an increase in ground-to-seat height (from 10.5
                                                to 14
                                                in.). This translates to a much more natural seating position and
                                                less
                                                effort required to get in and out of the chair. Those with taller
                                                and
                                                broader builds can step up to a more supportive option like the Alps
                                                Mountaineering
                                                King Kong or Coleman Oversized Quad Chair with Cooler, which
                                                have higher backpanels and larger seats. However, those chairs sit
                                                noticeably higher off the ground at around 18
                                                inches&mdash;they&rsquo;re
                                                downright throne-like&mdash;and are much bulkier when folded down.
                                                In
                                                our opinion, the Skyward strikes a much healthier balance of size
                                                and
                                                weight for most campers, and the mesh-heavy build is a boon in hot
                                                summer conditions (the Alps and Coleman both have solid backs).</p>

                                                options for the camp chef abound in 2023. Our favorite, the Eureka
                                                Ignite Plus, combines reliable output and good simmer control on a
                                                wide,
                                                23-inch cooking surface that can accommodate bigger pots and pans.
                                                The
                                                two 10,000-BTU burners are plenty powerful for most campers, and the
                                                fine-tuned control is crucial for more involved meals. In addition,
                                                the
                                                Ignite&rsquo;s side shields do a good job of fending off light
                                                winds,
                                                the push-button ignition keeps your hands safe from large bursts of
                                                flame, and the locking lid and manageable 12-pound weight make for

                                                Everest 2X boasts double the output per burner (20,000 BTUs
                                                each), which is overkill for most but makes sense for those who get
                                                out
                                                a lot and like to cook intricate, diverse meals. On the flip side,
                                                infrequent campers who only camp a couple times a year can save
                                                considerably with a budget design like Coleman&rsquo;s
                                                Classic Propane ($75 MSRP and often found on sale), although you
                                                can expect a sizable drop in flame control and overall quality.
                                                Finally,
                                                those wanting to make an all-in-one purchase for both backpacking

                                                camping should check out MSR&rsquo;s WindBurner Stove Combo System
                                                ($300), which is relatively lightweight and portable and comes ready
                                                with a 2.5-liter pot and 8-inch skillet.</p>

                                                cooler market in
                                                2023 begs the question: How much does a camper really need to
                                                spend to get decent ice retention and capacity? For the ideal
                                                balance of
                                                quality and affordability, the RTIC 52 Ultra-Light fits the bill
                                                better
                                                than the rest. At 21 pounds, it&rsquo;s lighter than most hard-sided
                                                coolers of comparable size and quality, and undercuts nearly all of
                                                them
                                                in price at $200. And while most coolers in this size range check in
                                                at
                                                45 or 65 quarts, the RTIC provides a versatile 52 quarts of storage,
                                                which is plenty for two people for a long weekend while still
                                                fitting
                                                easily in a car trunk. It&rsquo;s also important to note that RTIC
                                                sells
                                                direct to consumers through their website (and often at a discount),
                                                keeping the RTIC surprisingly affordable for its quality.</p>
                                            <p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size: 16px;">The downside to
                                                RTIC&rsquo;s direct-to-consumer model is that you can&rsquo;t check
                                                out
                                                their coolers in person at your local retailer. The RTIC also falls
                                                a
                                                bit short in ice retention compared to more premium designs like the
                                                Yeti Tundra and Roadie, though not as much as might be expected
                                                given
                                                its lower price (the similarly sized Yeti Tundra 65
                                                costs $175 more). In addition, the Ultra-Light is a bit less durable
                                                compared to the Tundra and other high-end options. But in the end,
                                                the
                                                RTIC&rsquo;s low weight, solid performance, and reasonable price
                                                make it

                                                have a couple of gripes about the RTIC&rsquo;s design. Like many

                                                coolers, the
                                                Soft Pack takes considerable effort (and two hands) to open,
                                                although
                                                the zipper is robust, highly leak-resistant, and good at sealing in
                                                cold. The organization layout is also pretty basic, including just a
                                                single pocket at the front, which limits the cooler&rsquo;s utility
                                                for
                                                picnics and instances when you&rsquo;re carrying smaller,

                                                Thankfully, many headlamp manufacturers are moving forward with
                                                USB-rechargeable models. Petzl, long known for their headlamp
                                                innovations, makes our favorite design in the Actik Core. With 600
                                                lumens (at max output), a long battery life, and consistent

                                                Core is a top performer. And our favorite feature is the

                                                versatility with both the rechargeable Core battery pack and AAA
                                                batteries, which is a great backup option for long stints in the

                                                headlamps are very well executed (especially compared to past

                                                from BD), and the standard models (no &ldquo;R&rdquo;) feature

                                                separately for $20). If you&rsquo;re looking for a budget headlamp

                                                can get the job done for camp chores and as an emergency lamp, the

                                                is our top recommendation, and with an IPX4 water rating, it&rsquo;s

                                                (it
                                                should work on most vehicles and crossbar sets), and we especially

                                                the latch and lock, which operate as two separate mechanisms (great

                                                rooftop cargo box, one of the first things to think about are
                                                dimensions, especially if you&rsquo;re toting skis, a cooler, or

                                                bulky items. And while it&rsquo;s tempting to opt for a more
                                                budget-oriented model than the Motion XT, it&rsquo;s our opinion
                                                that
                                                this is a category where quality really matters. If you&rsquo;re
                                                consistently using your cargo box, it&rsquo;s worth the few extra
                                                hundred dollars to get stiff construction, long-lasting and secure
                                                handle and lock mechanisms, and smooth-operating mounts. You can
                                                drop
                                                down to Thule&rsquo;s Pulse ($600), for example, but the combined
                                                handle
                                                and lock puts a lot more strain on the lock, resulting in an issue
                                                with
                                                broken keys. In the end, the Thule Motion XT offers top-notch
                                                quality
                                                for a reasonable cost, and it&rsquo;s also worth considering

                                                camping trip in all sorts of ways&mdash;a backpack works, as does a
                                                Rubbermaid or a suitcase. But our favorite way to tote our camping
                                                gear
                                                is in duffel bags,
                                                thanks to their durability, easy access, and multiple carry options.
                                                Patagonia&rsquo;s Black Hole lineup is our favorite: These duffels
                                                certainly get &ldquo;cool&rdquo; points, but that&rsquo;s not all
                                                that
                                                nudges the 55-liter version into our top spot. What really shines is
                                                the
                                                Black Hole&rsquo;s tough construction (900D ripstop nylon),
                                                moisture-shedding DWR finish, and premium build quality. The
                                                Patagonia
                                                also stands apart with its carrying comfort and features, including
                                                a
                                                wide U-shaped opening and backpack straps, which we&rsquo;ve found
                                                to be
                                                more comfortable and functional than most. Plus, starting in 2022,
                                                all
                                                Black Hole Duffels are made with 100% recycled materials. It&rsquo;s
                                                no
                                                wonder these duffels are often out of stock, though waitlists are
                                                available for patient shoppers.&nbsp;</p>

                                                is
                                                that the Black Hole doesn&rsquo;t boast a lot of
                                                structure&mdash;only
                                                the base is lightly padded&mdash;which is something to keep in mind
                                                when
                                                packing anything fragile or if you need to live out of your duffel
                                                for
                                                extended periods of time. It also rings up at the pricier end of the
                                                spectrum, especially for a duffel without wheels (which you
                                                won&rsquo;t
                                                need&mdash;or want&mdash;for most camping scenarios). But for the
                                                durability, comfort, and reliability it offers, we think the Black
                                                Hole
                                                is worth it&mdash;and it&rsquo;s also worth checking out designs
                                                like
                                                the The North Face Base
                                                Camp, Black Diamond Stonehauler, and Mountain Hardwear
                                                Expedition. In terms of size, we&rsquo;ve found that duffels in the
                                                55-
                                                to 90-liter range are by far the most functional for a range of
                                                uses.
