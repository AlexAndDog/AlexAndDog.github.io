                        <b>Sun Peaks Resort</b><br>
                        Centrally located in the Interior region of British Columbia, Sun Peaks Resort is Canada's
                        second
                        largest
                        ski
                        area. The terrain is diverse and spread across three mountains - Mt. Tod, Sundance and Mt.
                        Morrisey -
                        totalling
                        4,270 acres. Formerly Tod Mountain prior to 1993, the resort has developed into a year-round
                        community,
                        at
                        the
                        centre of which is a European-style, ski-through village including hotels, condos, restaurants
                        and
                        shops.
                        135
                        alpine trails flow into the village from 360Â° of terrain and over 34km of Nordic skiing trails.
                        From
                        groomed
                        cruisers to bumps, a progressive 10-acre terrain park, abundant glades, steeps and alpine bowls,
                        the
                        varied
                        terrain at Sun Peaks Resort accommodates all levels and abilities. Featuring 10% beginner, 58%
                        intermediate
                        and
                        32% advanced/expert terrain, the resort boasts that varying levels of skier and boarders can
                        ride up the
                        same
                        lift, take different trails down, and meet up at the same lift again. Sun Peaks receives 6
                        meters of
                        snow
                        annually in the form of light, dry powder conditions for which the Interior of BC is
                        famous.<br><br>

                        <em>Inside scoop for Sun Peaks Resort:</em> <br> Sun Peaks has become a very family friendly
                        resort with
                        many intermediate and beginner runs. But if you are an intermediate to expert skier, you are in
                        luck.
                        From
                        the village, take the Sunburst Express chairlift and then ski down Crystal Lane to the Crystal
                        chairlift.
                        From there you can access the more advanced terrain, but lets say there has been snow for a few
                        days and
                        its
                        skied. There are three and a half options, two of which involve hiking. Starting with the one
                        that
                        doesn't
                        involve hiking at all, at the top of the world you will head into 5 mile (don't worry you won't
                        be on it
                        long), next you will exit at the place where you would start the hike for the gills. Instead of
                        hiking
                        you
                        will turn right and cross over (there will be some tracks leading this way) you will find
                        yourself
                        parallel
                        to 5 mile. When you feel comfortable you can ski down to 5 Mile. Its a short piece, but it can
                        be full
                        of
                        deep soft snow. PS. Going a little further into the glades can hold some amazing snow, but just
                        don't go
                        too
                        far! From there you can head up to Write Rabbit and ski some mogels, or if you feel like it,
                        head in a
                        bit
                        sooner or later and ski some trees. If you go further, there's really nice snow, but you'll want
                        to be
                        careful as it can get really tight when you exit White Rabbit, you'll end up on the Gills Cat
                        Track,
                        then on
                        "The Other Way" where there are some fun glades that originate from the mountain biking at Sun
                        Peaks.
                        From
                        there just head up the 5 mile to the Elevation Chair and head up for another lap!<br>
                        The other option is to hike to the top of Tod Mountain. This is a slightly longer hike, but it
                        is worth
                        the
                        the snow. Follow the same start as the last option, but instead of turning right, you will go
                        straight
                        up
                        the mountain and hike up the mountain. The hike is about 30 minutes, but well worth it. The snow
                        is
                        usually
                        barely touched. Ski down and you have a couple of options. You can choose, but my suggestion is
                        to go to
                        the
                        far left and ski offset. Just a little bit down the hill and up a little bit and you will find
                        yourself
                        in
                        some glades. Keep going left and you'll find a wide glade that eventually closes and gets quite
                        narrow.
                        narrow, but keep going straight and you'll find yourself on a cat track. This is the sucky part,
                        you
                        just
                        had untouched powder, but now you have to pay the price, you have to skate and pull all the way
                        across.
                        all the way. But once you get to the end, you can head up the elevation chair and do it all over
                        again!<br>
                        If you've been keeping track, we have one and a half options left. When you get off the Crystal
                        Chair,
                        turn
                        left. Instead of going straight, turn left towards the sign that says "The Chef". Next you'll
                        cross
                        between Sunnyside and The Chef. If you get the line right, you will come to a sign that says
                        Mid Mountain, Toilet Bowl and Father Toms. Continue towards Mid Mountain. Here's the half
                        option, you
                        can
                        You can decide to hike Mid Mountain, it is about a 5 minute hike or less, despite what the sign
                        says.
                        There's usually
                        usually some nice snow. If you don't want to hike, you can ski down to the left and take a lift
                        back to
                        Mid
                        Mountain.
                        Station to catch a lift back to the top.

                <p><b>Whistler Blackcomb</b><br>

                        Within British Columbia's glacial climate and scenic beauty resides Whistler and Blackcomb
                        Mountains.
                        The

                        impressive 8,171 acres of accessible terrain is serviced by 36 lifts and the longest continuous
                        lift
                        system
                        on the globe, PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola, which connects skiers and riders from Whistler to Blackcomb
                        Mountains.

                        Whistler was originally conceived as part of a bid to host the 1968 Winter Olympics. Although
                        the bid
                        was
                        ultimately unsuccessful, construction began, and the resort opened in 1966. After years of
                        expansions
                        and a
                        merger with Blackcomb Mountain, Whistler was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in
                        association with
                        Vancouver.

                        There are over 18 restaurants between the two mountains, ensuring that you don't have to waste
                        time
                        going
                        into Whistler to find food. Also, for those who want to extend their ski season, Blackcomb
                        offers summer
                        skiing and riding in June and July.

                        Whistler is located about two hours from Vancouver. The easiest way to get there is by car. You
                        can fly
                        into
                        Vancouver International Airport (YVR). Once you get to Vancouver, you can take the Rocky
                        Mountaineer
                        Whistler Sea to Sky climb train or bus to get to the resort. You could also rent a car or look
                        into
                        rideshare options.<br><br>

                        Blackcomb's upper alpine area is supreme, and Seventh Heaven has lived up to its name more than
                        a few
                        times.
                        Massive glade options on the lower half and wide open powder bowls on the top make this my #1
                        choice for
                        any
                        powder-filled morning.<br><br>

                        If you are looking for something a little more adventurous, make the hike up and onto the
                        Blackcomb
                        Glacier,
                        accessible by the Glacier T-Bar found at the top of the Glacier Express Quad. You may note that
                        while on
                        the
                        Jersey there is a line of hikers to your left making their way up to what's known as Spanky's
                        Ladder,
                        which
                        provides access to Ruby Bowl - I recommend you follow their lead.<br><br>

                        Not for the faint of heart, this is an adrenaline pumping double diamond run which most days
                        delivers a
                        grin
                        from ear to ear.<br><br>

                        The Blackcomb Glacier is more tame, and features a nice little hike to its entrance with a wide
                        open
                        powder
                        bowl waiting to reward you for your efforts. And don't miss out on a signature Blackcomb
                        experience - a
                        stop
                        in for some stellar waffles at the Crystal Hut.<br><br>

                        RED Mountain is the last great, unspoiled resort. Located in Rossland, BC, along the famous
                        "Powder
                        Highway," RED delivers 4,200 acres of pristine skiing unfettered by overdevelopment. For
                        2013-14, the

                        Inside scoop for advanced skiers at RED Mountain Resort:<br>
                        On Red Mountain, the popular Red Towers run under the chairlift is great for confident mogul
                        riders who
                        are
                        happy to perform to an audience. Similarly the black runs under the Motherlode chair also form
                        bumps
                        very
                        quickly, and are not for the shy skier or snowboarder. For a bit more privacy, the Powder Fields
                        in
                        amongst
                        the trees are a fantastic place to play. The tightness of the trees varies significantly, and it
                        can be
                        a
                        little difficult to ascertain whether you're about to hit an advanced or expert line, and don't
                        expect
                        rocky
                        outcrops to have an impending warning sign.<br><br>

                        For more great tree skiing, the War Eagle trees on Red Mountain are rated as double black but
                        are very
                        manageable. There is an abundance of potential lines, many of which follow the fall line, and
                        you can
                        drop
                        down anywhere into Sally's Alley or Dale's Trail.<br><br>

                        Grey Mountain also offers some nice advanced piste and off-piste terrain when the snow's good.

                <p><b>Big White Ski Resort</b><br>
                        Big White Ski Resort is a great destination for all types of skiers and snowboarders, offering
                        wide
                        expansive terrain, light dry powder, short lift lines and modern facilities. The Big White
                        Village is
                        home
                        to the most ski-in/ski-out accommodations in Canada.

                        Located in scenic British Columbia's Okanagan Valley, Big White is about 56 kilometers or 35
                        miles
                        outside
                        the town of Kelowna. The ski area is situated on the side of Big White Mountain and offers
                        terrain
                        suited to
                        span the spectrum of ability levels. The resort is an excellent family destination offering a
                        wide array
                        of
                        family-friendly activities, including snowshoeing, tubing, skating, snowmobiling, dog sledding,
                        horse-drawn
                        sleigh rides and Nordic skiing.<br><br>

                        Inside scoop for Big White Ski Resort:<br>
                        If your skiing at Gem Lake, then try heading over to Mustang Sally. You might also find some
                        left on
                        Snowy, Blue Moon and even Fourth Ace. Because these runs are at the far edge of Big White's
                        boundaries
                        and
                        take a bit of traveling to get to, they are often forgotten about and it's where I tend to still
                        find
                        fresh
                        un-tracked powder right through the day.<br><br>

                        and
                        boards.

                        Silver Star's village is reminiscent of a typical 19th century British Columbian mining town era
                        with
                        Victorian architecture. Boarded sidewalks and brightly colored shop fronts add a unique western
                        flavor.

                        you also
                        can
                        enjoy some unique Victorian-style vacation homes.

                        Silver Star averages more than 700 cm of snow annually (23 feet). There are 12 lifts, including
                        a

                        trails,
                        the
                        majority intermediate, but with plenty of beginner and advanced action.

                        Enjoy cross-country skiing? Well, members of numerous national teams, including Canada and the
                        U.S.,
                        will
                        tell you Big White's Nordic trails are among their favorites.

                        The resort is 22 km (12 miles) from Vernon. Easiest bet from there is to take the Vernon

                        Inside scoop for Kicking Horse Mountain Resort:<br>
                        Now that ski patrol is bombing Superbowl, it's officially got the best cliffs. From multiple
                        five
                        footers to
                        massive double stagers, you can find all that you need to pretend you are in a ski movie, or go
                        30' past
                        Terminator summit and drop right for a cliff-free run. Want to explore? Do not follow tracks.
                        Sidecountry
                        here is seriously big and avalanche prone.<br><br>
                        On a powder day, head out on CPR ridge, and go far, far down (you may think you've gone too far,
                        but
                        when a
                        local blows by you at full speed, keep following her direction). Drop to your right for steep,
                        soft
                        trees,
                        and at the bottom, keep heading right, waaay right, for soft snow all the way down. At the
                        bottom you
                        will
                        funnel back to the base.<br><br>

                        Inside scoop for advanced/expert skiers at Fernie Alpine Resort:<br>
                        Boasting over 2,500 acres of skiable terrainâand 30-percent of it rated expertâFernie likes to
                        brag that
                        they have âmore expert terrain than the size of most ski areas.â Rightfully so. With 142 marked
                        trails
                        and 5
                        massive alpine bowls, Fernie has more than enough to keep you self-proclaimed experts on your
                        toes. But
                        where to start?

                        With the addition of a high-speed quad to the top of the 7,000-foot Polar Peak just a few years
                        back,
                        getting to the steep stuff at Fernie is easier than ever. Right from the top, rip literally any
                        trail
                        and
                        enjoy the expansive views of the Kootenays' as you descend.

                        When you're feeling ready, make your way over to the Currie Bowl for some of the best steeps on
                        the
                        mountain. Sky Dive is a particular favorite, and the Currie Glades harbor some seriously fun

                        Flush
                        #44 - Black
                        Flush is one of our staff's favourite spots, it's been the site for our JEEP Junior Freeski comp
                        for the
                        last few season as it's got plenty of playful terrain, lots of little hits and bumps. The first
                        part of
                        the
                        run is mellow, tree skiing and often home to late stashes of that perfect purcell powder
                        Kimberley is so
                        known for. Much of Kimberley's history is owed to mining, being home to at one time, the largest
                        producing
                        zinc mine in Canada, therefore a lot of the runs in Kimberley lend their name to that legacy,
                        Flush is
                        no
                        exception as it's named after a mining claim. (Plus there's a natural half pipe at the
                        bottom)!<br><br>
                        Dreadnaught
                        #4 - Blue
                        Also, named after a mining claim, Dreadnaught offers great variation, with wide open meandering
                        groomers
                        at
                        the top to fun rolling terrain near the bottom. The Kootenay Haus, located at the top of the run
                        offers
                        some
                        of the best views of the valley and entire run. Dreadnaught is the dedicated race run for Nancy
                        Green
                        and
                        other race training and race events.
                        Locals Tip - The front side is THE perfect intermediate terrain, long fall-line cruisers on
                        corduroy
                        groomed
                        softpack (typically). Kimberley has the best cruisy groomers in the Kootenays hands
                        down.<br><br>
                        Geneva
                        #59 - Black
                        One of our locals' favourite run is called Geneva, it's located in the gladed area known as The
                        Black
                        Forest, the largest tree skiing area in North America. Geneva is a long leg burner with very
                        interesting
                        and
                        variable terrain and is always the first stop after a large overnight powder dump (and you can
                        see why
                        from
                        this picture).<br><br>
                        Dorval
                        # 50 - Black
                        Top runs - DorvalOur next undisclosed spot is also located in the Black Forest. Another one
                        named after
                        a
                        staked mining claim, Dorval is a forever favourite of our staff as most people ride right on by
                        it! Our
                        theory is everyone is too busy making their way to the Easter chair to notice this spot and pass
                        it by,
                        but
                        next time we suggest you try it out! To get to Dorval, ski right of the intersection to Dean's
                        Right and
                        Ridgeway, some of the best attributes of Dorval are - it's one of the steepest runs on the hill
                        and is
                        only
                        groomed once a week. One of the rarest experiences you'll have on this run is actually seeing
                        another
                        soul
                        riding near you and if you do, there's a safe bet they work at the resort or grew up skiing
                        there.<br><br>
                        Tamarack
                        #28 - Black
                        Tamarack AKA the 'show off' run because; top to bottom, Tamarack runs fully below the chair of
                        the same
                        name. Since many people don't like to ride right under the lift and be exposed to chairs and
                        chairs of
                        onlookers, there are often fresh tracks to be found here! Tamarack's fall link is top to bottom
                        with a
                        vertical rise of 1182 ft, making it a real thigh burner to ride and get that heart rate up. Hit
                        up
                        Tamarack,
                        then it's time hit up the hot tub!<br><br>

                        expanded
                        its offering even further by opening 128 acres of double black diamond terrain including an epic

                <p><b>Revelstoke Mountain Resort</b><br>
                        Revelstoke Mountain Resort is a ski area located in British Columbia, Canada, just outside of
                        the town
                        of
                        Revelstoke. The ski area is located approximately 120 miles from Kelowna International Airport,
                        which
                        offers
                        direct flights from Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton and
                        Calgary.
                        Revelstoke Mountain is the only resort in the world offering lift, cat, heli and backcountry
                        skiing from
                        one

                        Inside scoop for Revelstoke Mountain Resort:<br>
                        There's an enormous swath of north-facing terrain called Greely Bowl that requires a bit of
                        effort to
                        access, but is always worth the work. Hike up the boot pack to Sub Peak from the top of the
                        Stoke Chair,
                        drop into North Bowl and catch the first traverse you hit, tracking right. Bring friends and
                        snacks:
                        You'll
                        be out there for a while. Always stay inbounds, though, and keep your eyes peeled for surprise

                        Located in the heart of the Okanagan Valley about 30 minutes from Penticton, BC, Canada, Apex
                        Mountain
                        Resort is one of the hidden gems of Canadian skiing. Averaging 600cm of âOkanaganâ powder each
                        season,
                        skiers and riders have access to 1,112 acres that include groomers, bowls, glades, and a terrain

                        Inside scoop for Apex Mountain Resort:<br>
                        he grooming is very nice, and beginners and low end intermediates have wide runs with negligible
                        camber
                        that
                        are easy for learning. Some of the black runs are groomed intermittently, such as Chute and runs
                        on the
                        Wildside (the backside), which are speedy fun for upper intermediate to advanced riders. And if
                        venturing to
                        the backside, snowboarders will need to traverse to get there and have plenty of speed on the
                        exit.<br><br>

                        Apex Ski Resort has lots of challenging terrain and for many lines, the differential between
                        single and
                        double black diamond is somewhat blurred. Terrain options include wide-open bumps such as those
                        under
                        the
                        quad chair, glades, and tight trees. Tooth is a great run with a double black entry, then you
                        can relax
                        as
                        it tapers out, and then enjoy being spat out via steep tight trees.<br><br>

                        Or for backcountry, Apex Mountain proper is an easy hike away, where you'll find some super
                        steep and
                        avalanche prone chutes.<br><br>

                        Inside scoop for Mount Washington Alpine Resort:<br>
                        Some of the best trails on this mountain are found in an area known as the Outback, home to the
                        resort's
                        steeps and deeps. The
                        exceptionally unique Boomerang chair, added to the mix in 2004, is the quad that gets you into
                        this
                        area.
                        The chair rolls over the top of the ridgeline, offering lift access on both sides. Riders of the
                        "Boom"
                        can
                        hop on at the front side and ski the front if they choose, or head to the Outback and stay there
                        all
                        day,
                        returning to the front side at the end of the day.<br><br>

                        Mount Washington Alpine Resort, BC Canada
                        Mount Washington offers some excellent glade skiing.
                        If you head to the Outback, take a little hike along the top of the ridgeline where you will
                        find some
                        of
                        Mount Washington's prime terrain. Billabong and Copper, both double black runs, are two super
                        runs that
                        are
                        sure to get your heart racing. They're not overly steep, but they deliver a pretty good pitch
                        matched up
                        with some stellar snow.<br><br>

                        Moving off Billabong, which by far was the best run of our day, we rocked into the Copper Glades
                        -
                        perfectly
                        spaced trees that hang on a moderately steep slope.<br><br>

                        It has some very decent tree skiing if you catch it when the snow's good; the best bits are
                        below
                        Skychair,
                        the trees off Panorama (marked as 'Detention Glades' on the map), and the trees around Slash and
                        Moons
                        (marked as 'Crator Glades' and 'Under the Volcano Glades'). You can also get some awesome skiing
                        on the
                        actual runs under Raven chair - the handful of black runs there are left ungroomed all season
                        and have a
                        steep gradient. This of course means they get badly moguled, and they can be pretty icy with the
                        freeze-thaw
                        conditions that are common, but if you catch them when they're just right - i.e. on a quiet
                        weekday
                        after a
                        heavy dump - they're absolutely brilliant (you can also get into the trees there, but the
                        undergrowth is
                        very dense in places so it's not as good as the other areas I mentioned). If you're at Cypress
                        on a
                        powder
                        day, Raven is the first place to check out; if that's no good, make for the trees
                        elsewhere.<br><br>

                        A Manning you can't really go wrong. The terrain is not very aggresive and the snow is often
                        really good
                        as
                        it catches the pacific oceans moisture. The resort is not very busy, so lines are not very
                        concerning.

                        former
                        logging owner, and due to massive power lines. In a place where powder lines should be the main
                        feature,
                        there are three lots of incredibly ugly power lines that cut a scar across an otherwise pretty
