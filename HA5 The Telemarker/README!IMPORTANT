- In folder (I know it's big), you will find: 
- 5 folders
     - Data - all the cooridnates of the poly(and multi)gons on the map. 
           This folder also includes more javascript files that I used to create the map. 
          (I used the Leaflet library and a template from github. The credits are in the code credits file).
     - Images - The images for the map (from the leaflet library).  
     - Leaflet - The leaflet library.  
     - Menu - The menu folder is the control centre of my project. it includes all the sites
          - Articles - The articles folder includes all the articles that I wrote for the project. 
              Which you can find by dropping any of the sport menus down and clicking on article, 
              then you chose the article of your liking.
          - BaseArticles - The pages where you choose what article you want to read.
          - Credits - The drop down with all the credit pages, including the code credits, photo credits, and useful links. 
              (the article links can be found in the articles).
          - Stats - This folder contains two pages, (these are the longest files due to the tables). 
              The stats I have made over the years.
